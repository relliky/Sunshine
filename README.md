# Sunshine
Product Sunshine is a simple low-cost low-power thermostat non-invasive solution to the heating system widely used in bill-included-in-rent OpalÂ® student accommodations around UK. A proposal written by me was approved by University of Sheffield and this project was kindly funded by Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department Derek Griess Programme. The project started from scratch and went through marketing, product definition, design, and verification for given the amount of time, ending up with a working hardware prototype on breadboard.  Background: International students and freshers usually trend to live in student accommodations where they pay fixed bills, such as electricity bills. However, they often have sleeping issues in the winter since the timer of the radiator typically found in such student accommodation work for a maximum period of two hours. Therefore, if they wake up because they feel cold, they either have to get up to turn on the radiator again by pressing a button on the timer, or stay in the bed and hope they can fall asleep again. To address this issue, the essential aim of this project is to develop a simple, cheap, reliable thermostat attaching to the radiator timer so that the thermostat is able to press the button on the existing room timer automatically to make sure the radiator is as necessary on throughout the night with a comfortable room temperature.
